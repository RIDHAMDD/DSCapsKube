    "### 4. Removing Stopwords\n",
    "**What This Does:**  \n",
    "Here we remove common words like **\"the\"**, **\"is\"**, and **\"and\"** that don't add much meaning to our text\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "Input: `\"The cat is running\"`  \n",
    "Output: `cat running`\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Lemmatization\n",
    "**What This Does:**  \n",
    "Lastly this reduces words to their base or dictionary form- making words like **\"running\"** become **\"run\"**\n",

    "**NOTE:** I couldn’t apply all of these functions (I commenetd them) because some of them took too long during preprocessing which slowed down my entire code execution. Functions like <u>lemmatization </u> and <u>stopword removal</u> require tokenizing text and performing word lookups making them computationally expensive. Since I was working on a large dataset, running all functions together would take a lot of processing power and time. If you have a fast GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), your system probably can handle these tasks much faster because faster GPUs are optimized for parallel processing allowing multiple computations at the same time. If you have a powerful machine, you can try using both the functions I commented on your system for better text cleaning/improved model accuracy"

    "### Why I used a 70-30 Split?\n",
    "\n",
    "A 70-30 split is commonly used in machine learning because it balances model training and evaluation. In my dataset here, there are **487,235 entries**, meaning **70% (about 341,065 samples)** will be used for training, and **30% (about 146,170 samples)** will be used for testing. Training on 70% of the data ensures the model learns patterns effectively while the remaining 30% allows us to check how well it performs on unseen data. This helps prevent overfitting, where the model memorizes the training data but fails on new data. The dataset is large enough that even 30% I feel will provide a strong solif evaluation set\n"

    "### **Why these models? How do they predict AI vs human text?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The models I chose to classify text as AI or human are based on word patterns, term importance and statistical relationships. They process text using **CountVectorizer** (to convert words into numbers) and **TF-IDF Transformer** (to weigh important words) before training on different classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)**\n",
    "#### **Why this model?**\n",
    "Naïve Bayes is **fast, efficient and well-suited for text classification** in general. It assumes each word in a text contributes independently to the classification so it makes it useful for tasks like spam detection and sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How it predicts?**\n",
    "- It **calculates probabilities** of words appearing in AI vs human-written texts I give it\n",
    "- If a word is **more common in an ai generated text**, it assigns a higher probability to AI\n",
    "- The final classification is based on the **highest probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Pros**\n",
    "pretty fast and works well with large datasets \n",
    "performs well even if there is limited training data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Cons**\n",
    "\n",
    "assumes word independence, which may not always be accurate  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**\n",
    "If words like \"AI\", \"generated\", and \"algorithm\" appear frequently in AI-written text the model will **classify a text as AI-generated if these words are present in high probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **2. Logistic Regression**\n",

    "#### **Pros**\n",
    "powerful for complex datasets\n",

    "#### **Cons**\n",
    "for sure slower training time compared to naive bayes and logistic reg\n",

    "XGBoost is an optimized version of gradient boosting that runs faster and prevents overfitting. It’s widely used in text classification and fraud detection. I initially had three in mind, but later decided to include this one as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How it predicts?**\n",
    "- Like gradient boosting, it corrects mistakes iteratively\n",
    "- It applies <u>regularization </u> to avoid overfitting on patterns that don’t generalize well\n",

    "#### **Cons**\n",
    "reequires careful tuning of hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**\n",
